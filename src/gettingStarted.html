  <h2> What's an API?</h2>
  <div id="normText">
    <p>Imagine that you want to bake a cake. Most of us go to the grocery store for ingredients, while very few of us start out use begin by planting a field of wheat. </p>
    <p>APIs are similar to shopping at a grocery store. Grocers provide access to ingredients, and those indgredients are used in a multitude of recipes.  APIs provide access to information,
      information that would otherwise be strenous or impractical to obtain. MCS Computer Vision API provide access to image analytics. </p>
    <p>
    <p>
      Requesting image analysis begins by sending an image to the MCS Computer Vision API. The image is then analysed
	    and the user receives a response. The response includes detailed keywords which describe
      the image based on MCS's image analysis algorithms.</p>

  <h1>How to get started </h1>
  <p>1.  Go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/sign-up?ReturnUrl=/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions?productId=%2fproducts%2f54d873dd5eefd00dc474a0f4">Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API</a>
  </p><p>2.  Microsoft Cognitive Services requires that a user has an existing account with Microsoft, Github, or LinkedIn. </p>
  <p>3.  If you do not already have an existing account through one of these, create one, and then return to this page. </p>
  <p>4.  Select the account you would like to connect to Microsoft Cognitive Services by clicking on the Microsoft, Github, or LinkedIn button links. </p>
	<img src="deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/MCSgetstarted.png" id="strawberry">
  <p>5.  You will then be directed to a login page through your Microsoft, Github, or LinkedIn account.  Enter your username and password associated with your Microsoft, Github, or LinkedIn account.</p>
    <p>6.  Your Microsoft, Github, or LinkedIn account will open and you should see a message at the top of the page that says “Your email was verified.” Then you will be asked to grant authorization to Microsoft Cognitive Services (abbr
    on) to access your account. Select Yes. This takes you back to the MCS site.</p>
   <p>7.  Now you will be prompted to make the email address associated with your Github, or LinkedIn account public. Go to that account and change your email setting to public (if not already set that way). You can change it back to private after this initial
    login process. </p>
  <p>8.  Now navigate back to MCS services. Under “Subscribe in seconds”, select the account of your choice once again (Microsoft, Github, or LinkedIn). </p>
  <p>9.  Then you will be taken to your actual MCS account. At the top right, click the button that says “Send Verification Email”. The button will
	change to “Verification email has been sent”. </p>
  <p>10.  Now go to your email account. Open the email just sent to you by MCS. Click on the link after “This email address was recently used to sign up with Microsoft Cognitive Services. Please verify this is
	  correct by visiting:”[link]. You will be taken back to your MCS account where you will see the screen below. Click on "Get Started For Free. </p>
	 <img src="deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/mcs verified.png" id="strawberry">
  <p>11.  This takes you to the "Request new trials” page. Scroll down until you see the list of APIS to choose from under "Product name".
    Locate the Computer Vision API and select the check box next to "Computer Vision - Preview 5,000 transactions per month, 20 per minute." </p>
  <p>12.  Now scroll to the bottom of the page and select the checkbox to agree to the MCS terms and privacy statement. Click "Subscribe". </p>
  <p>13.  Now a new page will take you to your key listings. Arrow down and click on “show” to reveal your key. Copy this alpha-numerical key code, we will be using this later. </p>
 <img src="deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/keys.png" id="strawberry">
	<p>14.  At the top of the page under the APIS drop down menu, select “Computer Vision”. On the main Computer Vision page, select the box labeled “Documentation”.  </p>
15.  Now that your MCS account has been created and you have an API key, you now move on to making a call to the Computer Vision API.
