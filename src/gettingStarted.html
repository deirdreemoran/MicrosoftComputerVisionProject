		<h2> What's an API?</h2>
		<p>Imagine that you want to bake a cake. Most of us go to the grocery store for ingredients, while very few of us 
		start out by planting a field of wheat. </p>
		<p>APIs are similar to shopping at a grocery store. Grocers provide access to ingredients, and those ingredients are used in a multitude of recipes. APIs provide access to information,
		information that would otherwise be strenuous or impractical to obtain. MS Computer Vision API provides access to image analytics. </p>
		<p>Requesting image analysis begins by sending an image to the MS Computer Vision API. The image is then analyzed
		and the user receives a response. The response includes detailed keywords that describe
		the image based on the API's image analysis algorithms.</p>

	<h1>How to get started </h1>
	<p>
		1. Go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-US/sign-up?ReturnUrl=/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions?productId=%2fproducts%2f54d873dd5eefd00dc474a0f4">Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API</a>
	</p>
	<p>2. Microsoft Cognitive Services (MCS) requires a user to have an existing account with Microsoft, GitHub, or LinkedIn. </p>
	<p>3. Create an account if you do not already have one through one of these sources. Return to this page when you are done. </p>
	<p>4. Click on the Microsoft, GitHub, or LinkedIn button to select your preferred account. </p>
		<img src="https://deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/MCSgetstarted.png" id="strawberry">
	<p>5. You will then be directed to a login page through your Microsoft, GitHub, or LinkedIn account. Enter the username and password associated with your preferred account.</p>
	<p>6. Your preferred account will open, and you should see a message at the top of the page that says, “Your email was verified.” You will be asked to grant authorization to MCS to access your account. Select Yes. This takes you back to the MCS site.</p>
	<p>7. Next you will be prompted to make the email address associated with your preferred account viewable by the public. Go to that account and change your email setting to public (if not already set this way). You may change it back to private after this initial
		login process. </p>
	<p>8. Now navigate back to MCS services. Under “Subscribe in seconds”, select your preferred account. </p>
	<p>9. You are taken to your MCS account. At the top right, click the button that says, “Send Verification Email”. The button will
		then change to “Verification email has been sent”. </p>
	<p>10. Now go to your email account. Open the email just sent to you by MCS. Click on the link after “This email address was recently used to sign up with Microsoft Cognitive Services. Please verify this is
		correct by visiting: ...”. You are taken back to your MCS account where you will see the screen below. Click on "Get Started For Free. </p>
	<img src="https://deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/mcs verified.png" id="strawberry">
	<p>11. This takes you to the "Request new trials” page. Scroll down until you see the list of APIS choices under "Product name".
		Locate the Computer Vision API and select the check box next to "Computer Vision - Preview 5,000 transactions per month, 20 per minute." </p>
	<p>12. Now scroll to the bottom of the page and select the checkbox to agree to the MCS terms and privacy statement. Click "Subscribe". </p>
	<p>13. Now a new page will take you to your key listings. Arrow down and click on “show” to reveal your key. Copy this alpha-numerical key code, we will use this later to connect to the MCS. </p>
	<img src="https://deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/keys.png" id="strawberry">
	<p>14. At the top of the page under the APIS drop down menu, select “Computer Vision”. On the main Computer Vision page, select the box labeled “Documentation”. </p>
	15. Now that your MCS account has been created and you have an API key, we move on to
	<a href="https://deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/src/requestAnalysis.html?" >requesting 
	image analysis</a>.
