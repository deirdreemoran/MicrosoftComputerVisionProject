<h1> Requesting image analysis </h1>
  <h3>Terminology</h3>
	 
	<div><b>Request parameters</b> are defined by the API and tell the user what kind of data it will accept and
		allow the user to adjust how that data is analyzed and returned.  Common parameters in the Computer Vision API incolve
		image size, content, and language.  </div><br>
		<div><b> Key-value pairs </b> let us define our request parameters.  For example, if we know
			that we need our data to be returned in a specific language, we set the "language parameter" by providing
			a key and corresponding value assigned to that key.  The key for this particular language parameter would 
			be "language" and its value would be set as "en", to indicate English.  Each parameter and its key-value(s)
			pair are listed	and described on the MCS method pages.  We'll link to each page as we go through different
			Computer Vision API methods.</div><br>
		<div><b>Request URL </b>is the web address we send our request to.  Our parameters will be included in our request url
			as key value pairs.  The basic anatomy of a request url is illustrated below.<br>
				<img src="keyvalpairs.png" id="valpairs"><br>
		  	The general request url is stated on each API documentation page.  Instead of listing specific key-value
			pairs, the general url request will list the keys inside braces, like this:   <br>
<br> https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/ocr[?language][&detectOrientation ]
			</div>
			
			We will need to specify our parameters as key value pairs like in the anatomy of a url request illustration above, NOT
			like the general url request with brackets[].
		<br><b> POST and GET methods </b>are HTTP request methods.  According to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp" >w3schools</a>, 
				a GET method "requests data from a specified resource," while a POST method "submits data to be processed to a specified resource".
				The Computer Vision requests that we cover are POST requests, where the user is selecting and 
			sending parameters to the API with the help of an HTML form. 
			<div> <b>JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) </b> structures data that will be sent from a browser to a the API server.  
			JSON acts as an interpreter between the two, changing our objects to readable code.  The method call <b>JSON.stringify()
				</b> basically converts	our object (the url with parameters) into a string for the server to read.  The method call to
			<b>JSON.parse </b> converts the string that the server sends back to us into an object with 
			identifiable properties.  We'll look at how to process the response data after we go over making calls to the API.</div>  <br>
		 <b> The data we send</b> is allowed to be in the form of: an image URL, text, or an image file upload.	 We'll only be looking 
	  at URL and text entry in this guide, but I hope to incorporate image upload into this guide at some point.<br>
			<div><b> More terms will be defined as they arise throughout this guide.  This
				at least familiarizes and refreshes us on some of the basics.</b></div>
		<h1> Method 1:  Analyze Image </h1>
		<div> Analyze Image offers three <i>parameters</i> to choose from:
			<br>Visual Features
			<br>Details
			<br>Language<br>
		<div>We'll start by setting up our first parameter, Visual Features.  
			<br>Visual Features allows us to specify up to seven keys, which are already well documented and 
			may be referred to
				<a href="https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa" >here</a>.
 			We'll include all of them in this first example.  To set up our Request url, we need to list 
			the key 'visualFeatures' and then pair it with every value, like we did in our anatomy of a url request before, and like
			this now: <br>
			 <i> https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Tags,Description,Faces,ImageType,Color,Adult&details=Celebrities&language=en</i>
			<br>For each value we list, we must separate one from the next with a comma, as that is what our API is 
				 expecting.  
			<br>
			For the second key, 'details', we list it immediately after the last "visualFeatures" value, separated by
			an ampersand:<br> https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Tags,Description,Faces,ImageType,Color,Adult&details=Celebrities</div>
			<br>
			For out last key, 'language', we'll list its key-value pair at the very end, specifying the value 'en' for English and also separat it from the 
				 previous key value pair with an ampersand:<br>
<i> https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Tags,Description,Faces,ImageType,Color,Adult&details=Celebrities&language=en</i>
	<br>
			This request url now includes every parameter for Computer Vision's Analyze Image method. </div>
			<br>
	Now onto writing a program for our browser that will send an image url to the MCS Computer Vision API.
			<br>We will create and then examine each line of code piece by piece, and then finally combine our
			lines of code into a whole program at the very end.  
			<br>First, we'll need to communicate with our HTML code in order to collect the image we 
				would like to have analyzed.
<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/ogd9hjs7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>	'DOMContentLoaded' is signaled to execute when our HTML page loads.  Our JavaScript program is listenting to hear this 
	signal by adding 'addEventListener' onto our document.  When our paramater 'DOMContentLoaded' fires, we call 
	another function "bindButtons, to begin our program.  <br>
			For our next line of code, we define our bindButtons method that was just called in the previous line:
<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/9/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>		<br>	Now we create an XMLHttpRequest() request object:
	<div><iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/8/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br></div>
			As <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">Mozilla's Developer site <a>defines it, "XMLHttpRequest is an API that provides client functionality 
	for transferring data between a client and a server. It provides an easy way to retrieve data from a 
	URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just a part of the
	page without disrupting what the user is doing."  This will allow our program to call the Computer Vision API while still keeping our
	html form populated.<br>
			Onto the next line: <div>  
	<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>	<br></div>	
	Here we declare an object (payload) that will carry our parameters to the API.  Payload is the object we want to give to the Computer Vision API. 
			On the right hand side, we have "{url: null}".  We need to use "url" as our key here, as Computer Vision API
			is expecting this exact key.  The key, "url", has its value set to "null" because we still need to get the 
			url entered in our form and assign it to this key.<br>
			 <br>      
			Now we need to connect some of the stuff we just defined and put it all together in our next line of code:
<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/6/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>			
	  We want to look at our HTML 'document' and get the form field value of the element with the id tag "url".
			We assign this value to "payload.url".  Now our payload object's key "url" will contain the value of the url
			from our form.<br>
			
			Our POST request:
			<div><iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/5/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>	</div>
			We open our request without reloading the page and specify our method as POST.  Then we take our request
	URl that we created earlier, put it inside quotation marks, and tack on true at the end.  "true" specifies our 
	request as asynchronous.<br>
	As <i>Eloquent Javascript</i> explains <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/17_http.html">here </a>quite well, "This means that when we call send, the only thing that happens right away 
	is that the request is scheduled to be sent. Our program can continue, and the browser will take care of the sending 
	and receiving of data in the background.  But as long as the request is running, we wonâ€™t be able to access the response. We need a mechanism that will notify us when the data is available.
	For this, we must listen for the "load" event on the request object."  We'll broach asynchronicity again when we 
	get to load.<br>
	
			Now we set our request headers.  The first of which let the MCS server know what type of data we are sending, and the second
	request header specifies our API subscription key which we created when we initially signed up:
			<br>	<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/4/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>      <br>
	  <div id="normText">			
			Now back to asynchronicity.  We are attaching another event listener in our next line of code 
			 to signal us when the response data is ready to be processed.  We haven't actually called our send 
				method yet, but we need to attach this listener function beforehand so we have something
				to work with when the response data is available to us:
			<br>	<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><br>
			Now we need to set up how we'll handle our response data by addressing status code scenarios.
			The repsonses are fully documented on the MCS page, so we'll just create the code here and not go into
			too much depth.   <br><iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/2/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
				I included console.log to help us identify and solve problems in case we run into any while our program executes.  They
				are not necessary and may be omitted. 
				As we defined earlier, JSON.parse is taking the server's
				response (a string) and is dividing it up into content that our browser can read.  It parses
				the response into an organized object which we will examine in the next section.
				<br>
				In our last bit of code, we first close out our listener function and then send our request.  
				Then we protect our page from reloading with the event.preventDefault() method.<br>
<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/1/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>			
				<br>Now that we have a pretty good understanding of how to make requests to our 
				API, we will proccess some returned data. <br><br>
