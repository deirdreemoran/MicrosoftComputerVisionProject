		<h1> Requesting image analysis </h1>
		<div id="normText"> <h2>Terminology</h2>
	 	<div><b>Request parameters</b> are defined by the API and tell the user what kind of data may be requested. 
		Common parameters in the Computer Vision API include image size, content, and language.  </div><br>
	
		<div><b> Key-value pairs </b> define the specified request parameters.  For example, to specify our language of
		choice, the key is set as "language" and its value is set as "en" to indicate English language.  
		</div><br>
		
		<div><b>Request URL </b>is the API's address.  Our request parameters will be included in the request url
		as key value pairs.  The basic anatomy of a request url is illustrated below.<br>
		<img src="https://deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/images/keyvalpairs.png" id="valpairs"><br>
		Request URLs are listed on the API documentation page.  <br>
		</div><br>
			
		<b> POST and GET methods </b>are HTTP request methods.  A GET method basically requests data from the API,
		whereas a POST method processes data it is sent.   In our case, we are using a POST request, as we
		will be sending parameters and an image to the API. <br>
			
		<div> <b>JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) </b> translates the data we send from our browser to API server, and vice versa.
		JSON acts as an interpreter between the two end points.  When we call <b>JSON.stringify()
		</b>, JSON converts our object (the url with request parameters) into a string 
		for the server to read.  The method call to <b>JSON.parse </b> converts the 
		image analysis response that the server sends back to us.  
		</div>  <br>
		 
		<h1> Analyze Image </h1>
		
		<div>To set up our first parameter, Visual Features, we refer to the API's
		<a href="https://westus.dev.cognitive.microsoft.com/docs/services/56f91f2d778daf23d8ec6739/operations/56f91f2e778daf14a499e1fa" >documentation guide.</a>
		For our example, we are going to include all Visual Features.  To set up our Request URL, our 
		<b> key </b> is'visualFeatures' and our values are 'Categories,Tags,Description,Faces,ImageType,Color,Adult'.
		For the second key, 'details', we list it immediately after the last "visualFeatures" value, 
		separated by an ampersand, like so:
		<br><br><i> <b>https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Tags,Description,Faces,ImageType,Color,Adult&details=Celebrities</div>
			</i></b><br>
		For our last key, 'language', we'll list its key-value pair at the very end, specifying the value 
		'en' for English and also separate it from the previous key value pair with an ampersand:<br><br>
		<i><b> https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/analyze?visualFeatures=Categories,Tags,Description,Faces,ImageType,Color,Adult&details=Celebrities&language=en</i>
			</b></div>
		
		<br>
		<div id="normText"> Now onto writing a program that will send an image URL to the API.  We will 
		create and then examine each line of code piece by piece, and then finally combine our
		lines of code at the very end.  
		<br><br>To begin, we need to communicate with our HTML code in order to send the image we 
		would like to have analyzed.<br>
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/ogd9hjs7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>	
			'DOMContentLoaded' is signaled to execute when our HTML page loads.  Our JavaScript program is listenting to hear this 
		signal by adding 'addEventListener' onto our document.  When our paramater 'DOMContentLoaded' fires, we call 
		another function 'bindButtons()', to begin our program.  <br>
		For our next line of code, we define our bindButtons method that was just called in the previous line:	
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/9/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>		<br>	Now we create an XMLHttpRequest() request object:
		<div><iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/8/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br></div>
		The XMLHttpRequest is actually an API itself that allows 
		data to be transferred to and from the server. This enables a web page to update a portion
		of the page without disrupting what the user is doing.  </br>
		Onto the next line: <div>  
	
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>	<br></div>	
		<div>
		Here we declare an object (payload) that will carry our parameters to the API.  Our payload is the object we want 
		to deliver to the API. On the right hand side, we have "{url: null}".  We need to use "url" as our key here, 
		as Computer Vision API is expecting this exact key.  The key, "url", has its value set to "null" 
		because we still need to get the url we specidy in our form.  
		Now we need to put it all together in our next line of code:<br>
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/6/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>			
	  	<br>We want to look at our HTML 'document' and get the form field value of the element with the id tag "url".
		We assign this value to "payload.url".  Now our payload object's key "url" will contain the value 
		of the url from our form.<br>
		Our POST request:
		
		<div><iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/5/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>	</div>
		We open our request without reloading the page and specify our method as POST.  
		We then take our request URL, put it inside quotation marks, and follow it with "true" to specify our 
		request as asynchronous.<br><br>
		When we call send, our request gets scheduled to be sent. Our program can continue to run while 
		the browser sends and receives data in the background.  To get a notification when the server responds,
		we must listen for the "load" event on the request object.  <br><br>
		Now we set our request headers.  The first of which tells the server what type of data we are sending, and the second
		request header specifies our API subscription key that was created when we initially signed up:<br>
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/4/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>      <br>
	  
		<div id="normText">	<br>		
		Now back to asynchronicity.  We are attaching another event listener in our next line of code 
		to signal when the response data is ready to be processed.  We haven't actually called our send 
		method yet, it's only scheduled at this point.  We need to attach this listener function 
		beforehand so we have something to work with when the response data is available to us:
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/3/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><br>
		Now we need to set up how to handle our response data by addressing different return 
		status code scenarios.  The repsonse formats are fully documented on the MCS documentation page.
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/2/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><br>
		<br>I included console.log here to help us identify and solve problems by printing out what our process is doing while it
		executes.
		They are not necessary and may be omitted. 
		As we defined earlier, the call to JSON.parse is taking the server's
		response (a string) and dividing it up into content that our browser can read.  It parses
		the response into an organized object which we will examine in the next section.
		<br><br>
		In our last bit of code, we close our listener function and then send our request.  
		We protect our page from reloading with the event.preventDefault() method.<br>
		<iframe width="60%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/morand/r5s1594u/1/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>			
		<br><br>Now that we have a pretty good understanding of how to make requests to our 
		API, <a href="https://deirdreemoran.github.io/MicrosoftComputerVisionProject/src/requestAnalysis.html" >let's proccess some returned data!</a>
